referrence link for TimeGPT -> https://docs.nixtla.io/docs/use-cases-forecasting_web_traffic


original case study on the dataset -> https://cienciadedatos.net/documentos/py37-forecasting-web-traffic-machine-learning

This was done with an intent to an introduction to TimeGPT with my previous learnings of Time Series and Forecasting . Way lesser code was used and still it matched similar prediction quality wrt original study.
